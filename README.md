This repository would contain some simple yet interesting problems found on the internet.
Some of the problems might use the concepts of APIs.
Problems:
a) talking_clock:
  The talking clock problem is a classic example of using python text to speech conversion.
  The problem statement is that given a time in 24hr format, output the time in natural conversational form.
  Eg: input : 00:00
              01:30
              12:05
              14:01
              20:29
              21:00
      output :  It's twelve am.
                It's one thirty am.
                It's twelve oh five pm.
                It's two oh one pm.
                It's eigth twenty nine pm.
                It's nine pm.
                
 The required python module is: pyttsx3 (offline) (or gTTS for online use) (or pyttsx for python 2.x)
